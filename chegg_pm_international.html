        <h3>Deep Dive: Local Currency Presentment</h3>
        <p>At Chegg, I led an initiative to improve international conversion by making our offering more relevant and accessible in key markets. We focused on deeply understanding local user needs and removing barriers to purchase. This work became critical as ChatGPT rapidly undercut our product-market fit and we needed to prove continued growth to Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Through a program of continuous discovery that I had instituted with my designer and eng lead, we already had a pretty good idea of the international opportunity space. Customer journey mapping and funnel analysis revealed we had significant drop-off on our pricing and packaging page for international users. Improving passthrough rate on this page would drive CVR downstream.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Through customer interviews and session replay analysis we knew that a big reason that international users were dropping off here was because the page was not contextually relevant to them. The pricing was in USD, the product was priced for US purchasing power, and the value props were geared towards US customers. I recall watching user after user double click our pricing, ostensibly to go to google to convert pricing in one usability test.</p>
